<b>Arrowstorm is an realtime online multiplayer archery game inspired by the game Towerfall.  You can play the game at <a href="http://arrowstorm.tech">arrowstorm.tech</a></b>

Arrowstorm was built with the help of many libraries, primarily Phaser.io for the canvas/webGl, Socket.io to connect players to the server, Express for the server, and Postgres/Sequelize for the maps database.

Our most updated version can be found on the dev branch; for the stable release deployed to arrowstorm.tech, checkout the master branch.

Arrowstorm was created by <a href="https://github.com/Mojotatan">James Byrd</a>, <a href="https://github.com/agcpbg">Alex Cherubin</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/nishmeht7">Nishant Mehta</a> as a project for <a href="https://www.fullstackacademy.com/">Fullstack Academy</a>.  The textures for the stone, cobblestone, dirt, grass, and wood blocks were borrowed from Minecraft.  The Black Mage player sprite was adapted from Final Fantasy I.  The dungeon and arena backgrounds were borrowed from Brave Frontier.  The treasure chest texture was borrowed from AdventureQuest.  All other images were created by us.
